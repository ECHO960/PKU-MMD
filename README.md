# PKU-MMD
PKU-MMD is a new large scale benchmark for continuous multi-modality 3D human action understanding and covers a wide range of complex human activities with well annotated information. PKU-MMD contains 1076 long video sequences in 51 action categories, performed by 66 subjects in three camera views. It contains almost 20,000 action instances and 5.4 million frames in total. Our dataset also provides multi-modality data sources, including RGB, depth, Infrared Radiation and Skeleton.
